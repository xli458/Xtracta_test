# Xtracta_test

Input files:
“invoice.txt”: words of an invoice generated by the OCR engine
“suppliernames.txt”: a list of supplier names

Run the main program:
Version 1:
“suppliernames_finder.py” 
(The function is included in the file "bisearch.py")

Version 2:
“suppliernames_finder2.py” produces the same result, and this program is slightly lengthier. But I think this one has better scalability than the previous version.  
In this version, I added some supplier names to the file to make the problem more difficult:
 “demo comp”, “demo company2” and “demo company3”.
The new supplier names are in “suppliernames_mod.txt”.

Output:
“word_list.xlsx”: information extracted from “invoice.txt”
		- First column: page number
		- Second column: line number
		- Third column: position of word
“invoice_rec.xlsx”: reconstructed invoice from “invoice.txt”
“Sup_name_found.xlsx”: a list of company names found in the invoice
